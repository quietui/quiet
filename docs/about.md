Quiet was built by [Cory LaViska](https://x.com/claviska), the creator of [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/). With the success of Shoelace, many of you are probably wondering why I'd choose to build another UI library, and that's a reasonable question.

The truth is, Shoelace has matured a lot over the years. While that's a great thing for its users, as an artist, I've lost my canvas for creativity. I'm still committed to Shoelace and it has a very promising future — it has a full team now and we're building an amazing product out of it. But it's not my personal playground anymore.

**Enter Quiet, my creative outlet.**

A passion project. Something I'm building from scratch to explore new ideas and have fun with. A place where I can satisfy my component addiction without breaking things.

Quiet leans towards the bleeding edge of what's become possible with browsers in recent years. It uses modern features more than it probably should. It goes further than just components. Quiet isn't meant to compete with Shoelace — it's a testbed for me to try new things that may or may not work and improve my skills as a designer and developer.

As a result, you'll find that Quiet is rather opinionated. I carefully curate everything from the project's scope down to every individual line of code. Oftentimes, saying "no" is key to maintaining the quality of the library and my ability to steward it effectively.

## My commitment to accessibility

I recognize the need for all users, regardless of ability or device, to have undeterred access to the websites and applications that are created with my software. This is an important goal of my projects.

Oftentimes, people will ask "is it accessible?" I'm reluctant to answer because accessibility isn't binary — there's no simple "yes" or "no" response to provide. What seems accessible to a sighted user might be completely inaccessible to a non-sighted user. And even if you optimize for various screen readers, you still have to account for low-level vision, color blindness, hearing impairments, mobility impairments, and more.

Accessibility is something you have to continuously strive for. No individual contributor — or perhaps even an entire team — can claim their software is 100% accessible because of the sheer diversity of abilities, devices, assistive technologies, and individual use cases.

Furthermore, accessibility doesn't stop at the component level. Using accessible building blocks doesn't magically make the rest of your webpage or application compliant. There is no library or overlay that will make your software "fully accessible" without putting in the effort.

My commitment to my users is this: everything I develop will be built with accessibility in mind. I will test and improve my software to the best of my ability and knowledge. I will work around upstream issues, such as browser bugs and limitations, to the best of my ability and within reason.

I'm fully aware that I won't get it right every time for every user, so I invite the community to participate in this ongoing effort by submitting issues, pull requests, and discussions. Many accessibility improvements have already been made thanks to contributors submitting code, feedback, and suggestions.

This is the path forward. Together, we will continue to make accessible software for as many users as possible.

## Special thanks

I'd like to thank the following projects and people for making Quiet UI possible.

## What's with all the cats?

I'm not really sure. They keep sneaking into the docs. I think they like the logo. <quiet-icon name="paw" style="rotate: -10deg; translate: 0 2px;"></quiet-icon> <quiet-icon name="paw" style="rotate: 15deg; translate: 0 -4px;"></quiet-icon>
