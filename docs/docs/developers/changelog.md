You should feel comfortable using any component marked <quiet-badge variant="primary">stable</quiet-badge> in production. Stable features are well-tested and unlikely to see breaking changes. Experimental components are less stable and subject to change more frequently.

This project is not anchored to a major version. Breaking changes will be made when necessary and a new major version will be released to reflect that. When breaking changes do happen, they'll be clearly marked with [BREAKING] so you can upgrade with minimal friction. 

## 1.0.0-beta.1
