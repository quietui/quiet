### Quick start

```html
<script type="module" src="/dist/quiet.loader.js"></script>
```

Here's a button.

```html {.example}
<!-- Put things here! -->
<quiet-button>
  Click me
</quiet-button>
```

Here's a code block for testing:

```css
:root {
  --custom-prop: blue;
  --another-prop: tomato;
}
```

Look at these nice callouts.
