Quiet is an open source project made available under the:

[GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-lesser-general-public-license-v3-lgpl-3) ("LGPL")

This means you can:

- **Use the library** in commercial and non-commercial software without having to release your own source code.
- **Modify the library** as long as you distribute all changes under the LGPL.
- **Distribute the library** with your application as long as the library and all changes to it are distributed under the LGPL.

If you're developing a commercial application and would like to use Quiet without the restrictions of the LGPL, you can purchase a commercial license.

## Commercial licenses

Commercial licenses are available for a ==one-time cost== per seat. This includes unlimited projects and zero LGPL restrictions. A discount is offered when multiple seats are purchased at the same time. Please [review the full license](TODO) prior to making a purchase.

  <p><strong>For a limited time, commercial licenses are available for only $99 per seat!</strong></p>

## Frequently asked questions

Can't find your question below? [Ask it here!](https://github.com/quietui/quiet/discussions)

<details name="faq">
  <summary>Why the LGPL?</summary>
  Good software takes time. Great software takes patience, passion, and a relentless pursuit of perfection. Quiet wasn't built by a corporation, it was built by me, an independent developer. The LGPL gives me the flexibility to open source the software with reasonable restrictions and commercial licensing gives me the means to continue improving it.
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>Does my stylesheet need to be released under the LGPL?</summary>
  No, stylesheets you create with your own custom CSS do not need to be licensed under the LGPL.
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>Can I use Quiet for my design system?</summary>
  Yes, but you will need a commercial license if you don't want to make your modifications available under the LGPL. A commercial license removes that restriction instantly.
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>Do you offer a free trial?</summary>
  You can use the open source version of Quiet in a non-production environment to determine if it's a good fit for your needs. A commercial license is required before deploying the software to production unless you fully comply with the LGPL.
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>What is a "seat?"</summary>
  In the context of licensing, a "seat" is any user who designs, develops, and/or works with the library's HTML, CSS, or JavaScript on a regular basis. For example, a small team with one designer and two developers would purchase a license for three seats.
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>Can I buy more seats later?</summary>
  You can purchase additional seats any time using the form on this page. However, the discount for additional seats cannot be honored for subsequent purchases, so it's better to buy more up front to get the maximum discount!
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>Will my license continue to work for new major versions?</summary>
  All licenses purchased today will be valid for all future versions of the library. If pricing changes later on, licenses purchased prior to the change will be grandfathered in.
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>How do you enforce licensing?</summary>
  My time is not well spent policing the Internet for people who use my software illegally. I will, however, defend against obvious rip offs and violations.
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>What is your refund policy?</summary>
  Refunds are offered up to 30 days from the date of purchase. I want you to be happy. And remember, you can try it before you buy it!
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>Do you offer support?</summary>
  I actively work on bugs, improve the library, and answer questions from the community. However, a commercial license isn't a guarantee of support. I ask that bugs be <a href="https://github.com/quietui/quiet/issues">reported on GitHub</a> and support questions be asked in the <a href="https://github.com/quietui/quiet/discussions">discussion forum</a> for the benefit of the community. I will always do my best to help and prioritize important bugs.
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>Can I request a feature?</summary>
  Features can be requested in the <a href="https://github.com/quietui/quiet/discussions/categories/feature-requests">discussion forum</a>. Please search before posting to prevent duplicate requests. Use the üëç reaction to vote for a feature.
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>Can I change the tag names?</summary>
  Component tag names, e.g. <code>&lt;quiet-button&gt;</code>, cannot be changed without modifying the source code due to the way tags are referenced in code and styles. Attempting to change tag names, e.g. by extending the associated classes, will cause unexpected breakages and isn't a supported feature of the library.
</details>

<details name="faq">
  <summary>Can I use this library with a micro frontend?</summary>
  Because custom elements are registered globally, I don't recommend using Quiet in a micro frontend architecture <em>unless</em> you move it to the top of the stack. Avoid loading the library multiple times, as this will cause version conflicts and load more code than is necessary.
