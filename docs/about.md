Quiet is an [open source](https://github.com/quietui/quiet/blob/main/LICENSE) user interface library for the modern Web. It features dozens of accessible, performant, localized, and interoperable components along with an optional CSS reset to streamline development of websites and apps.

You might be curious to learn that Quiet's components aren't built with React, Vue, or any other framework. They're custom HTML elements, or [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components), which means you can use them in plain ol' HTML _and_ with your favorite frameworks.

Every modern browser has the APIs necessary to support interoperable components that work everywhere. As a result, it makes little sense to continue building UI components in a specific framework. That just promotes lock-in. [Many of the world's largest companies](https://arewebcomponentsathingyet.com/) have been using Web Components in production applications for years.

With Quiet, you no longer need to learn a new UI library when you switch frameworks — just take it with you! And since it's built on top of stable platform APIs, it will continue to work for many years to come.

Quiet is built and maintained by Cory LaViska ([X](https://x.com/cory_laviska) / [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/cory.laviska.com)). With the success of [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/), many of you are probably wondering why I'd choose to build another UI library, and that's a reasonable question.

The truth is, Shoelace has matured a lot over the years. While that's a great thing for its users, as an artist, I've lost my canvas for creativity. I'm still committed to Shoelace and it has a very promising future — it has a full team and we're building an awesome product out of it! But it's not my personal playground anymore.

**Enter Quiet, my creative outlet.**

A passion project. Something I'm building from scratch to explore new ideas and have fun. A place where I can satisfy my component addiction, improve my design skills, explore new Web APIs, and let my curiosity run wild. ==A place to do things my way.==

As a result, you'll find that Quiet is rather opinionated. I carefully curate everything from the project's scope down to every individual line of code. Oftentimes, saying "no" is key to maintaining the quality of the library and my ability to steward it effectively.

## Tell me about the mouse

Why did I choose a mouse for Quiet's mascot? Because mice are quiet. Because the computer mouse was an incredible boon to UX. Because I've [rescued and raised](https://x.com/cory_laviska/status/1508128840937316360) numerous mice and other wildlife. It seemed like a good fit. But then something much deeper clicked…

As some of the world's [most](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur) [impressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_mammoth) [creatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smilodon) vanished into the mists of time, the humble mouse continued to live on. Their resilience reminds us that survival belongs not to the strongest or the most spectacular, but to those who can bend without breaking; who can find opportunity in adversity; who can thrive in the spaces between.

This library's power lies not in keeping up with the latest trends, but in speaking the timeless language of Web browsers. When the next framework extinction event comes, Quiet will live on, scurrying through the foundations of the Web, finding a home in every project that values simplicity over spectacle.

## What's with all the cats?

The cats? Oh, uh, I'm not really sure. They keep sneaking into the docs. I think they like the logo.
## Special thanks
