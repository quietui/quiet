Quiet is open source and available under the terms of the [MIT license](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license). This means you can use it for free and without attribution in any software project you want â€” even closed source applications.

## Are you making a profit?

If you've made it to this page, there's a good chance I've already saved you a lot of time.

I want Quiet to remain free for everyone to learn from. I don't get paid to build it so, if you're using this software in a commercial application, ==I respectfully ask that you sponsor the project== with a [one-time](https://github.com/sponsors/claviska?frequency=one-time) or [recurring donation](https://github.com/sponsors/claviska?frequency=recurring) via GitHub.

<quiet-button variant="primary" href="https://github.com/sponsors/claviska" target="_blank">Make a contribution</quiet-button>

Alternatively, I can accept [contributions through PayPal](https://paypal.me/claviska).

Your sponsorship lets me continue building this software for the greater good. All proceeds go directly to maintaining the library via new features, bug fixes, and support.
