This page describes the changes that happen throughout the library from version to version. It's important to note that Quiet is not [anchored to a major version](https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/anchoring-software-to-major-versions/). Breaking changes will be made when necessary and a new major version will be released to reflect them. When breaking changes do happen, they'll be clearly marked with [breaking] so you can upgrade with minimal friction. 

Components marked [stable] are well-tested, ready for production, and less likely to see breaking changes. Components marked [experimental] are offered as explorations to gather feedback. Experimental components are less stable and may receive breaking changes or be removed from the library without a major version bump.
