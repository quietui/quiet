Quiet is a user interface library for the modern Web. It features dozens of accessible, performant, localized, and interoperable components along with an optional CSS reset to streamline development of websites and apps.

You might be curious to learn that Quiet's components aren't built with React, Vue, or any other framework. They're custom HTML elements, or [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components), which means you can use them in plain ol' HTML pages as well as your favorite frameworks.

Every modern browser has the APIs necessary to create interoperable components that work everywhere. As a result, it makes little sense to continue building UI components in a specific framework — that promotes lock-in. [Many of the world's largest companies](https://arewebcomponentsathingyet.com/) have been using Web Components in production applications for years.

With Quiet, you no longer need to learn a new UI library when you switch frameworks. And since it's built on top of stable platform APIs, it will continue to work for many years to come.

Quiet was built by Cory LaViska ([X](https://x.com/cory_laviska) / [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/cory.laviska.com)), the creator of [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/). With the success of Shoelace, many of you are probably wondering why I'd choose to build another UI library, and that's a reasonable question.

The truth is, Shoelace has matured a lot over the years. While that's a great thing for its users, as an artist, I've lost my canvas for creativity. I'm still committed to Shoelace and it has a very promising future — it has a full team now and we're building an amazing product out of it. But it's not my personal playground anymore.

**Enter Quiet, my creative outlet.**

A passion project. Something I'm building from scratch to explore new ideas and have fun with. A place where I can satisfy my component addiction, explore new design ideas, and let my curiosity run wild.

As a result, you'll find that Quiet is rather opinionated. I carefully curate everything from the project's scope down to every individual line of code. Oftentimes, saying "no" is key to maintaining the quality of the library and my ability to steward it effectively.

## Special thanks

I'd like to thank the following projects and people for making Quiet UI possible.

## What's with all the cats?

I'm not really sure. They keep sneaking into the docs. I think they like the logo. <quiet-icon name="paw" style="rotate: -10deg; translate: 0 2px;"></quiet-icon> <quiet-icon name="paw" style="rotate: 15deg; translate: 0 -4px;"></quiet-icon>
