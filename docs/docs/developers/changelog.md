Quiet is still in beta and [might be for awhile](/docs/about), but you should feel comfortable using anything marked <quiet-badge variant="primary">Stable</quiet-badge>. Stable features are well-tested and unlikely to see breaking changes.

When breaking changes do happen, they'll be clearly marked [BREAKING] below so you can upgrade with minimal friction. Experimental components are less stable and subject to change.

## 1.0.0-beta.1

- Initial release
