## Frequently asked questions

:::details Where can I find my order history, Discord access, and tax receipts?
You can find your past orders, receipts, and get Discord access in the [customer portal](https://polar.sh/quietui/portal).
:::

:::details How can I report a bug? {.faq}
Bugs should be [reported on GitHub](https://github.com/quietui/quiet/issues). For best results, please include a minimal reproduction with your report.
:::

:::details When will my bug be fixed? {.faq}
I prioritize bug fixes that affect Insiders. I try to submit fixes quickly, but some bugs are tricky and require more time, research, etc. I will communicate my progress so you're always aware of what's happening.
:::

:::details How can I request a feature? {.faq}
Features can be [requested on GitHub](https://github.com/quietui/quiet/discussions/categories/feature-requests). Please search before posting to prevent duplicate requests and use the üëç reaction to vote.
:::

:::details Can I sponsor a feature? {.faq}
I generally don't accept sponsorships for specific features. This lets me focus on what's best for the project. Quiet is the result of many years of experience and my commitment to painstakingly curating the project. I want people to sponsor it because they see the vision, not because they want to change it.
:::

:::details What about server-side rendering (SSR)? {.faq}
_Framework SSR_ was created to solve problems introduced by client-side frameworks. When we moved to rendering everything with JavaScript, we broke SEO, social media previews, and page load performance. While framework SSR can be helpful in some scenarios, it's often misused to justify shipping massive JavaScript bundles that leave pages looking ready but completely unresponsive until everything loads and hydration completes.

The idea behind framework SSR is that fetching and hydrating can be done in the background before the user is likely to interact with the page. As such, it first sends the user a "fully painted" picture they can't actually do anything with while waiting for the browser to download and process a multi-megabyte bundle. However, it's become common to see 5+ seconds until [TTI](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/interactive) in the wild, leaving many users confused and frustrated.

Quiet isn't interested in supporting the framework SSR fallacy. As part of the platform, web components can be server-side rendered like all other HTML elements have since the early days of the Web. Just generate the appropriate HTML tags, import the components, and you're good to go.

If you're using Quiet's autoloader, it will efficiently fetch only the components you're using on the page. And to eliminate [FOUCE](https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/flash-of-undefined-custom-elements), the most common reason people reach for SSR when using web components, Quiet provides some [simple and effective tools](/docs/#reducing-fouce).

The key to a great experience on the web isn't SSR, it's less JavaScript. If you're of the belief that you need framework SSR and all the needless complexity it brings to a project, this library isn't for you.
:::

:::details Can I change the tag names? {.faq}
Component tag names, e.g. `<quiet-button>`, cannot be changed without modifying the source code due to the way tags are referenced in code and styles. Attempting to change tag names, e.g. by extending the associated classes, will cause unexpected breakages and isn't a supported feature of the library.
:::

:::details Can I subclass the components? {.faq}
While components are written as classes, they aren't designed to be subclassed. This is neither supported nor an objective of the library and doing so will cause things to break. Instead, use composition when possible.
:::

:::details Can I use this library with a micro frontend? {.faq}
Because custom elements are registered globally, I don't recommend using Quiet in a micro frontend architecture _unless_ you move it to the top of the stack. Avoid loading the library multiple times, as this will cause version conflicts and load more code than is necessary.
