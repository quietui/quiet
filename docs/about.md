Quiet is maintained by [Cory LaViska](https://x.com/claviska), the creator of [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/). With the success of Shoelace, many of you are probably wondering why I'd choose to build another UI library, and that's a reasonable question.

The truth is, Shoelace has matured a lot over the years. While that's a great thing for its users, as an artist, I've lost my canvas for creativity. I'm still committed to Shoelace and it has a very promising future — it has a full team now and we're building an amazing product out of it. But it's not my personal playground, anymore.

**Enter Quiet, my creative outlet.**

A passion project. Something I'm building from scratch to explore new ideas and have fun with. It leans towards the bleeding edge of what's become possible with browsers in recent years. It uses modern features more than it probably should. It goes further than just components. Quiet isn't meant to compete with Shoelace — it allows me to try new things that may or may not work and improve my skills as a designer and developer.

As a result, you'll find that Quiet is rather opinionated. I carefully curate everything from the project's scope down to every individual line of code. Oftentimes, saying "no" is key to maintaining the quality of the library and my ability to steward it effectively.

If Quiet isn't exactly what you want, it's probably not a good choice for your project. For the rest of you — those who see the vision and like living on the edge — go ahead and use it to your heart's content.

**But be warned…**

Expect a long beta period…maybe forever. Expect breaking changes. Expect that issues and <abbr title="Pull requests">PRs</abbr> will be closed when they don't align with my vision for the project. Expect that features will land when I get around to them. Expect me to be very picky about what makes it into the library, the quality of code, and every other aspect of how the project is maintained. Expect that I won't always want to accept a PR because I consider it out of scope or want to take my own shot at it.

_With all due respect, I'm not building this for you. I'm building it for me._

But don't be afraid to use it, learn from it, and have fun with it!

## My commitment to accessibility

I recognize the need for all users, regardless of ability or device, to have undeterred access to the websites and applications that are created with my software. This is an important goal of my projects.

Oftentimes, people will ask "is it accessible?" I'm reluctant to answer because accessibility isn't binary — there's no simple "yes" or "no" response to provide. What seems accessible to a sighted user might be completely inaccessible to a non-sighted user. And even if you optimize for various screen readers, you still have to account for low-level vision, color blindness, hearing impairments, mobility impairments, and more.

Accessibility is something you have to continuously strive for. No individual contributor — or perhaps even an entire team — can claim their software is 100% accessible because of the sheer diversity of abilities, devices, assistive technologies, and individual use cases.

Furthermore, accessibility doesn't stop at the component level. Using accessible building blocks doesn't magically make the rest of your webpage or application compliant. There is no library or overlay that will make your software "fully accessible" without putting in the effort.

My commitment to my users is this: everything I develop will be built with accessibility in mind. I will test and improve my software to the best of my ability and knowledge. I will work around upstream issues, such as browser bugs and limitations, to the best of my ability and within reason.

I'm fully aware that I won't get it right every time for every user, so I invite the community to participate in this ongoing effort by submitting issues, pull requests, and discussions. Many accessibility improvements have already been made thanks to contributors submitting code, feedback, and suggestions.

This is the path forward. Together, we will continue to make accessible software for as many users as possible.

## What's with all the cats?

I'm not really sure. They keep sneaking into the docs. I think they like the logo.
