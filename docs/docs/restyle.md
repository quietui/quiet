Quiet Restyle is an opinionated CSS reset you can use with or without its components. Kick off a new website or app that looks great without worrying about styling anything right away.

Add the following markup to the `<head>` of your document.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@quietui/quiet@{{package.version}}/dist/themes/restyle.css">
```
