Components marked [stable] are well-tested, ready for production, and unlikely to see breaking changes. Components marked [experimental] are offered as prototypes. Experimental components are less stable, subject to change, and may receive breaking changes without a major version bump.

This project is [not anchored to a major version](https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/anchoring-software-to-major-versions/). Breaking changes will be made when necessary and a new major version will be released to reflect that. When breaking changes do happen, they'll be clearly marked with [breaking] so you can upgrade with minimal friction.
