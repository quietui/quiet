Quiet was built by Cory LaViska ([X](https://x.com/cory_laviska) / [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/cory.laviska.com)), the creator of [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/). With the success of Shoelace, many of you are probably wondering why I'd choose to build another UI library, and that's a reasonable question.

The truth is, Shoelace has matured a lot over the years. While that's a great thing for its users, as an artist, I've lost my canvas for creativity. I'm still committed to Shoelace and it has a very promising future — it has a full team now and we're building an amazing product out of it. But it's not my personal playground anymore.

**Enter Quiet, my creative outlet.**

A passion project. Something I'm building from scratch to explore new ideas and have fun with. A place where I can satisfy my component addiction, explore new design ideas, and let my curiosity run wild.

As a result, you'll find that Quiet is rather opinionated. I carefully curate everything from the project's scope down to every individual line of code. Oftentimes, saying "no" is key to maintaining the quality of the library and my ability to steward it effectively.

## Special thanks

I'd like to thank the following projects and people for making Quiet UI possible.

- [Lit](https://lit.dev/) for making Web Components so fun to build
- [The Harmony color palette](https://evilmartians.com/opensource/harmony) for color inspiration
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) for generating the docs
- [The Custom Elements Manifest project](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/) for making API documentation easy
- [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) for positioning all the things
- [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons) for thousands of beautiful, open source icons
- [James Duncan](https://x.com/JamesDuncanArt) for drawing a super cool mascot

## What's with all the cats?

I'm not really sure. They keep sneaking into the docs. I think they like the logo. <quiet-icon name="paw" style="rotate: -10deg; translate: 0 2px;"></quiet-icon> <quiet-icon name="paw" style="rotate: 15deg; translate: 0 -4px;"></quiet-icon>
