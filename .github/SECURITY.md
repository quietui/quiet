# Reporting Security Issues

I take security issues very seriously and appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly.

To report a security issue, email [cory@abeautifulsite.net](mailto:cory@abeautifulsite.net) and include "QUIET UI SECURITY" in the subject line.

I'll respond as soon as possible and keep you updated throughout the process.
