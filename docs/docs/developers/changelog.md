Quiet is still in beta and [might be for awhile](/docs/about), but you should feel comfortable using anything marked <quiet-badge variant="primary">Stable</quiet-badge>. Stable features are well-tested and unlikely to see breaking changes.

If breaking changes do happen, they'll be clearly marked <quiet-badge variant="destructive">Breaking</quiet-badge> so you can upgrade with minimal friction.

## 1.0.0-beta.1

- Initial release
