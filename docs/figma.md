The Figma Starter Kit for Quiet UI aligns design and engineering with a single source of truth for common components. It's built to pick up and customize, rather than starting from scratch./

The Quiet Figma Starter Kit is built and maintained by [Ange Romanska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angeromanska/) and will be available to purchase in the coming weeks. The starter kit is sold separately from commercial licenses.
