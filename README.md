# Quiet UI

![Quiet UI logo](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1705198841094356992/1697645956/1500x500)

Quiet is a hand-crafted UI library built with [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components). It uses standardized browser APIs, so its components are highly portable and interoperable. That means you can use them with just about any JavaScript framework ‚Äî¬†or even without one!

Since Quiet is built with Web Standards, it's not tied to the lifespan of any framework. Learn it once, use it forever. Quiet has an accessibility-first philosophy and is laser-focused on providing the building blocks for amazing user interfaces for everyone on the Web.

## What's in the box?

- üß∞ A collection of quality components you can use to build beautiful, accessible, and consistent user interfaces with.
- üé® A curated CSS reset you can use to kick off projects without having to think about styling thing up front.
- ü™ô Customizable design tokens make it easy to change the look and feel any time.
- üê≠ A built-in autoloader that detects Quiet components in your HTML ‚Äî even ones you add dynamically ‚Äî and loads the bare minimum code for them to work.

## Getting started

## About this project

Quiet was built in New Hampshire by me, [Cory LaViska](https://twitter.com/claviska), the creator of [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/). With the success of Shoelace, many of you are probably wondering why I'd choose to build another UI library, and that's a reasonable question.

The truth is, Shoelace has matured a lot over the last few years. While that's a great thing for its users,¬†as an artist, I've lost my canvas for creativity. I'm still committed to Shoelace and I think it has a very promising future, but I'm no longer in charge of its design or its day to day operations. It has a full team now and we're building an amazing product out of it. It's not my personal playground, anymore.

Enter Quiet, my creative outlet. A passion project. Something I'm building to explore new ideas and have fun with. It leans towards the bleeding edge of what's become possible with browsers in recent years. It thinks more about progressive enhancement than it probably should. Quiet is in no way meant to compete with Shoelace. It's meant to allow me to try new things that may or may not work and improve my skills as a designer and developer.

As a result, you'll find that Quiet is rather opinionated. If it's not exactly what you want, it's probably not a good choice for your next project. Maybe consider using Shoelace instead. For the rest of you ‚Äî¬†the ones who like living on the edge and playing with newer browser APIs ‚Äî¬†go ahead and use it to your heart's content.

But be warned‚Ä¶

Expect a long beta period‚Ä¶maybe forever. Expect breaking changes. Expect that PRs will be closed when they don't align with my vision for the project. Expect that features will land when I get around to them. Expect me to be very picky about what makes it into the library, its quality of code, and every other aspect of how the project is maintained. Expect that I won't always want a PR because I prefer to experiment with things myself.

With all due respect, I'm not building this for you. I'm building it for me.

But don't be afraid to learn from and have fun with it!

‚Äî Cory
