Quiet is open source and available under the terms of the [MIT license](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license). This means you can use it for free and without attribution in any software project you want — even closed source applications.

If you've made it to this page, there's a good chance I've already saved you a lot of time.

I want Quiet to remain free for everyone to explore and learn from, but I don't get paid to build it. ==If you're using this software to make a profit==, I respectfully ask that you sponsor the project with a [one-time](https://github.com/sponsors/claviska?frequency=one-time) or [recurring donation](https://github.com/sponsors/claviska?frequency=recurring) via GitHub.
